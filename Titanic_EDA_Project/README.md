Handle missing values and fix data types

Perform descriptive statistical analysis

Generate group-based insights (e.g., survival by gender and class)

Visualize key patterns using bar plots and heatmaps

Explore correlations among numerical features

Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Pandas Profiling

Highlights
Cleaned and analyzed the Titanic dataset

Explored survival rates by gender, passenger class, and family relations

Created meaningful visualizations to uncover patterns

Built correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between features
